//! Vendored from pd-vm `f9ca4143f8ba2f486e270347504c49f5ea846097` after the
//! frozen core SHA dropped the public confined-FS / bounded-process surface.
//! Guest ABI is unchanged; these types are agent capability backends only.

//! Root-confined filesystem capability for host integrations.
//!
//! [`ConfinedFsRoot`] retains an operating-system directory handle and resolves
//! every later path relative to that handle. Relative paths are validated
//! before they reach the operating system. On Unix, Linux uses `openat2` with
//! `RESOLVE_BENEATH | RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS | RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS` when the
//! kernel provides it; the fallback walks each component with `openat`,
//! `O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW`, and never canonicalizes a path before opening
//! it. The root handle is never reopened through a path, including through
//! `/proc/self/fd`.
//!
//! Regular files with more than one hard link are rejected. This deliberately
//! conservative policy prevents a capability path from reaching an inode that
//! also has an unrelated directory entry. Atomic replacement is a Linux-only
//! `renameat2` capability (`RENAME_NOREPLACE` / identity-checked
//! `RENAME_EXCHANGE`). Other Unix targets fail closed with
//! [`ConfinedFsErrorKind::UnsupportedPlatform`] rather than creating a
//! temporary that can never be published. Publication returns a
//! [`ConfinedPublication`] once the destination name contains the retained
//! inode; parent-directory durability and staging cleanup are recorded on that
//! outcome instead of being reported as pre-publication failures.
//!
//! Windows and targets without a Unix descriptor API fail closed with
//! [`ConfinedFsErrorKind::UnsupportedPlatform`]. Reparse-point-safe handle
//! operations are not silently emulated by path-based calls.
